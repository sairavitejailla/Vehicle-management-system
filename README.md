# Vehicle-management-system
abstract class VehicleType having: private field: vehicle_type -> (Eg: scooter, car, bus) Use parameterized constructor to initialize the attribute. Make setter & getter methods for the attribute. An interface Color having: default method: getColor() -> which returns color (default: “white”) of vehicle An interface MfgDate having: abstract method: getMfgDate() -> will be used to return manufacturing date of vehicle Now create a class Vehicle which inherits MfgDate, Color & VehicleType and having: private field: mfg_date -> to store the manufacturing date of vehicle Use parameterized constructor to initialize the attribute. Make setter & getter methods for the attribute. Create Test class having main() method in which you have to make at least 5 objects of the Vehicle class and store them in ArrayList. Create another method named serializeVehicles() which will store all objects in a file named “Records.txt”. Now make another method named deserializeVehicles() which will read and display all those objects from the file whose manufacturing-date is > 2018.
